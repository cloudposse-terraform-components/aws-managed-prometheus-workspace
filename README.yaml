# Short description of this project
description: |-
  This component is responsible for provisioning a workspace for Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus, also known as
  Amazon Managed Prometheus (AMP).

  This component is intended to be deployed alongside Grafana. For example, use our `managed-grafana/workspace` component.
usage: |-
  **Stack Level**: Regional

  Here's an example snippet for how to use this component.

  We prefer to name the stack component with a simpler name, whereas the Terraform component should remain descriptive.

  ```yaml
  components:
    terraform:
      prometheus:
        metadata:
          component: managed-prometheus/workspace
        vars:
          enabled: true
          name: prometheus
          # Create cross-account role for core-auto to access AMP
          grafana_account_name: core-auto
  ```
